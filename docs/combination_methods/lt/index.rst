Lukin-Todd
==========

The Lukin-Todd (LT) is a combination method that employs an energy-smearing function as a local information measure. Each entry :math:`X_{k, m}` is computed as a weighted average of the samples :math:`X_{k, m}[p]`, where larger weights are given to samples on low-smearing neighborhoods. The LT method is computationally costly when compared to most other methods, as computing the smearing function requires sorting the samples in each neighborhood.
