Fast local sparsity
===================

The fast local sparsity (FLS) is a local information method that employs a local Hoyer sparsity measure to compute combination weights. Compared to other local information methods, the FLS is computationally efficient, as it does not require sorting vectors, and has been shown to achieve great performance in time-frequency resolution.
