Sample-weighted geometric mean
===============================

The sample-weighted geometric mean (SWGM) is a binwise combination method that computes each :math:`X_{k, m}` as a weighted geometric mean of the samples :math:`X_{k, m}[p]`. The weights are computed as a function of the samples themselves and give more importance to smaller values, such that the SWGM is a compromise between the geometric mean and the minimum.
